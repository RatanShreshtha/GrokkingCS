    "A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Max-Heap**: Key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.\n",
    "2. **Min-Heap**: key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.\n",

    "## Binary Heap Abstract Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binary Heap abstract data type is defined by the following structure and operations. A Binary Heap is structured, as described above, as an ordered collection of items where items are added to and removed from the end called the **top**. Binary Heaps are ordered **LIFO**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Heap Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `BinaryHeap()` creates a new, empty, binary heap.\n",
    "- `insert(k)` adds a new item to the heap.\n",
    "- `find_min()` returns the item with the minimum key value, leaving item in the heap.\n",
    "- `delete_min()` returns the item with the minimum key value, removing the item from the heap.\n",
    "- `is_empty()` returns true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.\n",
    "- `size()` returns the number of items in the heap.\n",
    "- `build_heap(list)` builds a new heap from a list of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "`h = BinaryHeap()` creates a Binary Heap that starts out empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing a BinaryHeap in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract data type (ADT) when given a physical implementation then we refer to the implementation as a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any object-oriented programming language, the implementation of choice for an abstract data type such as a **BinaryHeap** is the creation of a new class. The BinaryHeap operations are implemented as methods. Further, to implement a BinaryHeap, which is a collection of elements, it makes sense to utilize the primitive collections provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make our heap work efficiently, we will take advantage of the logarithmic nature of the binary tree to represent our heap. In order to guarantee logarithmic performance, we must keep our tree balanced. A balanced binary tree has roughly the same number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the root. In our heap implementation we keep the tree balanced by creating a **complete binary tree**, which can be represent by using a single `List`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap Order Property\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that we will use to store items in a heap relies on maintaining the heap order property. The heap order property is as follows: \n",
    "- In a heap, for every node x with parent p, the key in p is smaller than or equal to the key in x for **Min-Heap**. \n",
    "- In a heap, for every node x with parent p, the key in p is greater than or equal to the key in x for **Max-Heap**."
