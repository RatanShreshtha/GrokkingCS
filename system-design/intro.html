<h2>Characteristics of Distributed Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#characteristics-of-distributed-systems" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<section id="scalability">
<h3>Scalability<a class="headerlink" href="#scalability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Scalability is the capability of a system, process, or a network to grow and manage increased demand. Any distributed system that can continuously evolve in order to support the growing amount of work is considered to be scalable.</p>
<p>A system may have to scale because of many reasons like increased data volume or increased amount of work, e.g., number of transactions. A scalable system would like to achieve this scaling without performance loss.</p>
<p>Generally, the performance of a system, although designed (or claimed) to be scalable, declines with the system size due to the management or environment cost. For instance, network speed may become slower because machines tend to be far apart from one another. More generally, some tasks may not be distributed, either because of their inherent atomic nature or because of some flaw in the system design. At some point, such tasks would limit the speed-up obtained by distribution. A scalable architecture avoids this situation and attempts to balance the load on all the participating nodes evenly.</p>
<p>Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling: Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.) to an existing server. With horizontal-scaling it is often easier to scale dynamically by adding more machines into the existing pool; Vertical-scaling is usually limited to the capacity of a single server and scaling beyond that capacity often involves downtime and comes with an upper limit.</p>
</section>
<section id="reliability">
<h3>Reliability<a class="headerlink" href="#reliability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A distributed system is considered reliable if it keeps delivering its services even when one or several of its software or hardware components fail. Reliability represents one of the main characteristics of any distributed system, since in such systems any failing machine can always be replaced by another healthy one, ensuring the completion of the requested task.</p>
<p>A reliable distributed system achieves this through redundancy of both the software components and data. If the server carrying the user’s shopping cart fails, another server that has the exact replica of the shopping cart should replace it.</p>
<p>Obviously, redundancy has a cost and a reliable system has to pay that to achieve such resilience for services by eliminating every single point of failure.</p>
</section>
<section id="availability">
<h3>Availability<a class="headerlink" href="#availability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>By definition, availability is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period. It is a simple measure of the percentage of time that a system, service, or a machine remains operational under normal conditions. An aircraft that can be flown for many hours a month without much downtime can be said to have a high availability. Availability takes into account maintainability, repair time, spares availability, and other logistics considerations. If an aircraft is down for maintenance, it is considered not available during that time.</p>
<p>Reliability is availability over time considering the full range of possible real-world conditions that can occur. An aircraft that can make it through any possible weather safely is more reliable than one that has vulnerabilities to possible conditions.</p>
<p>Reliability Vs. Availability: If a system is reliable, it is available. However, if it is available, it is not necessarily reliable. In other words, high reliability contributes to high availability, but it is possible to achieve a high availability even with an unreliable product by minimizing repair time and ensuring that spares are always available when they are needed.</p>
</section>
<section id="efficiency">
<h3>Efficiency<a class="headerlink" href="#efficiency" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>To understand how to  measure the efficiency of a distributed system, let’s assume we have an  operation that runs in a distributed manner and delivers a set of items  as result. Two standard measures of its efficiency are the response time (or latency) that denotes the delay to obtain the first item and the throughput (or bandwidth) which denotes the number of items delivered in a given time unit (e.g., a second).  The two measures correspond to the following unit costs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Number of messages globally sent by the nodes of the system regardless of the message size.</p></li>
<li><p>Size of messages representing the volume of data exchanges.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The complexity of  operations supported by distributed data structures (e.g., searching for a specific key in a distributed index) can be characterized as a  function of one of these cost units. Generally speaking, the analysis of a distributed structure in terms of ‘number of messages’ is  over-simplistic. It ignores the impact of many aspects, including the  network topology, the network load, and its variation, the possible  heterogeneity of the software and hardware components involved in data  processing and routing, etc. However, it is quite difficult to develop a precise cost model that would accurately take into account all these  performance factors; therefore, we have to live with rough but robust  estimates of the system behavior.</p>
</section>
<section id="serviceability-or-manageability">
<h3>Serviceability or Manageability<a class="headerlink" href="#serviceability-or-manageability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Another important  consideration while designing a distributed system is how easy it is to  operate and maintain. Serviceability or manageability is the simplicity  and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained; if the time to fix a failed system increases, then availability will decrease.  Things to consider for manageability are the ease of diagnosing and  understanding problems when they occur, ease of making updates or  modifications, and how simple the system is to operate (i.e., does it  routinely operate without failure or exceptions?). Early detection of faults can decrease or avoid system downtime.</p>

</section>
<section id="load-balancing">
<h2>Load Balancing<a class="headerlink" href="#load-balancing" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Load Balancer (LB) is another critical component of any distributed system.  It helps to spread the traffic across a cluster of servers to improve  responsiveness and availability of applications, websites or databases.  LB also keeps track of the status of all the resources while  distributing requests. If a server is not available to take new requests or is not responding or has elevated error rate, LB will stop sending  traffic to such a server.</p>
<!-- ![image-20200809034311903](./staticfiles/images/image-20200809034311903.png) -->
<p>Typically a load balancer  sits between the client and the server accepting incoming network and  application traffic and distributing the traffic across multiple backend servers using various algorithms. By balancing application requests  across multiple servers, a load balancer reduces individual server load  and prevents any one application server from becoming a single point of  failure, thus improving overall application availability and  responsiveness.</p>
<!-- ![image-20200809034241335](./staticfiles/images/image-20200809034241335.png) -->
<p>To utilize full scalability and redundancy, we can try to balance the load at each layer of the system. We can add LBs at three places:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Between the user and the web server</p></li>
<li><p>Between web servers and an internal platform layer, like application servers or cache servers</p></li>
<li><p>Between internal platform layer and database.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="benefits-of-load-balancing">
<h3>Benefits of Load Balancing<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits-of-load-balancing" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Users experience faster, uninterrupted service. Users won’t have to  wait for a single struggling server to finish its previous tasks.  Instead, their requests are immediately passed on to a more readily  available resource.</p></li>
<li><p>Service providers experience less downtime and higher throughput.  Even a full server failure won’t affect the end user experience as the  load balancer will simply route around it to a healthy server.</p></li>
<li><p>Load balancing makes it easier for system administrators to handle incoming requests while decreasing wait time for users.</p></li>
<li><p>Smart load balancers provide benefits like predictive analytics that determine traffic bottlenecks before they happen. As a result, the  smart load balancer gives an organization actionable insights. These are key to automation and can help drive business decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>System administrators experience fewer failed or stressed  components. Instead of a single device performing a lot of work, load  balancing has several devices perform a little bit of work.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="load-balancing-algorithms">
<h3>Load Balancing Algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#load-balancing-algorithms" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>How does the load balancer choose the backend server?
Load balancers consider two factors before forwarding a request to a  backend server. They will first ensure that the server they choose is  actually responding appropriately to requests and then use a  pre-configured algorithm to select one from the set of healthy servers.  We will discuss these algorithms shortly.</p>
<p>Health Checks - Load balancers should only forward traffic to “healthy” backend servers. To monitor the health of a backend server, “health checks” regularly  attempt to connect to backend servers to ensure that servers are  listening. If a server fails a health check, it is automatically removed from the pool, and traffic will not be forwarded to it until it  responds to the health checks again.</p>
<p>There is a variety of load balancing methods, which use different algorithms for different needs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Least Connection Method — This method directs  traffic to the server with the fewest active connections. This approach  is quite useful when there are a large number of persistent client  connections which are unevenly distributed between the servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Least Response Time Method — This algorithm directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.</p></li>
<li><p>Least Bandwidth Method - This method selects the server that is currently serving the least amount of traffic measured in megabits per second (Mbps).</p></li>
<li><p>Round Robin Method — This method cycles through a  list of servers and sends each new request to the next server. When it  reaches the end of the list, it starts over at the beginning. It is most useful when the servers are of equal specification and there are not  many persistent connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Weighted Round Robin Method — The weighted  round-robin scheduling is designed to better handle servers with  different processing capacities. Each server is assigned a weight (an  integer value that indicates the processing capacity). Servers with  higher weights receive new connections before those with less weights  and servers with higher weights get more connections than those with  less weights.</p></li>
<li><p>IP Hash — Under this method, a hash of the IP address of the client is calculated to redirect the request to a server.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="redundant-load-balancers">
<h3>Redundant Load Balancers<a class="headerlink" href="#redundant-load-balancers" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The load balancer can be a single point of failure; to overcome this, a second load balancer can  be connected to the first to form a cluster. Each LB monitors the health of the other and, since both of them are equally capable of serving  traffic and failure detection, in the event the main load balancer  fails, the second load balancer takes over.</p>

</section>
<section id="caching">
<h2>Caching<a class="headerlink" href="#caching" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Load balancing helps you scale horizontally across an ever-increasing  number of servers, but caching will enable you to make vastly better use of the resources you already have as well as making otherwise  unattainable product requirements feasible. Caches take advantage of the locality of reference principle: recently requested data is likely to  be requested again. They are used in almost every layer of computing:  hardware, operating systems, web browsers, web applications, and more. A cache is like short-term memory: it has a limited amount of space, but  is typically faster than the original data source and contains the most  recently accessed items. Caches can exist at all levels in architecture, but are often found at the level nearest to the front end where they  are implemented to return data quickly without taxing downstream levels.</p>
<section id="application-server-cache">
<h3>Application server cache<a class="headerlink" href="#application-server-cache" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Placing a cache directly  on a request layer node enables the local storage of response data. Each time a request is made to the service, the node will quickly return  local cached data if it exists. If it is not in the cache, the  requesting node will query the data from disk. The cache on one request  layer node could also be located both in memory (which is very fast) and on the node’s local disk (faster than going to network storage).</p>
<p>What happens when you  expand this to many nodes? If the request layer is expanded to multiple  nodes, it’s still quite possible to have each node host its own cache.  However, if your load balancer randomly distributes requests across the  nodes, the same request will go to different nodes, thus increasing  cache misses. Two choices for overcoming this hurdle are global caches  and distributed caches.</p>
</section>
<section id="content-distribution-network-cdn">
<h3>Content Distribution Network (CDN)<a class="headerlink" href="#content-distribution-network-cdn" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>CDNs are a kind of cache  that comes into play for sites serving large amounts of static media. In a typical CDN setup, a request will first ask the CDN for a piece of  static media; the CDN will serve that content if it has it locally  available. If it isn’t available, the CDN will query the back-end  servers for the file, cache it locally, and serve it to the requesting  user.</p>
<p>If the system we are  building isn’t yet large enough to have its own CDN, we can ease a  future transition by serving the static media off a separate subdomain  (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="http://static.yourservice.com">static.yourservice.com</a>) using a lightweight HTTP server like Nginx, and cut-over the DNS from your servers to a CDN later.</p>
</section>
<section id="cache-invalidation">
<h3>Cache Invalidation<a class="headerlink" href="#cache-invalidation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>While caching is  fantastic, it does require some maintenance for keeping cache coherent  with the source of truth (e.g., database). If the data is modified in  the database, it should be invalidated in the cache; if not, this can  cause inconsistent application behavior.</p>
<p>Solving this problem is known as cache invalidation; there are three main schemes that are used:</p>
<p>Write-through cache: Under this scheme, data is written into the cache and the corresponding database at the same time. The cached data allows for fast retrieval  and, since the same data gets written in the permanent storage, we will  have complete data consistency between the cache and the storage. Also,  this scheme ensures that nothing will get lost in case of a crash, power failure, or other system disruptions.</p>
<p>Although, write through  minimizes the risk of data loss, since every write operation must be  done twice before returning success to the client, this scheme has the  disadvantage of higher latency for write operations.</p>
<p>Write-around cache: This technique is similar to write through cache, but data is written  directly to permanent storage, bypassing the cache. This can reduce the  cache being flooded with write operations that will not subsequently be  re-read, but has the disadvantage that a read request for recently  written data will create a “cache miss” and must be read from slower  back-end storage and experience higher latency.</p>
<p>Write-back cache: Under this scheme, data is written to cache alone and completion is  immediately confirmed to the client. The write to the permanent storage  is done after specified intervals or under certain conditions. This  results in low latency and high throughput for write-intensive  applications, however, this speed comes with the risk of data loss in  case of a crash or other adverse event because the only copy of the  written data is in the cache.</p>
</section>
<section id="cache-eviction-policies">
<h3>Cache eviction policies<a class="headerlink" href="#cache-eviction-policies" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Following are some of the most common cache eviction policies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>First In First Out (FIFO): The cache evicts the first block accessed first without any regard to how often or how many times it was accessed before.</p></li>
<li><p>Last In First Out (LIFO): The cache evicts the block accessed most  recently first without any regard to how often or how many times it was  accessed before.</p></li>
<li><p>Least Recently Used (LRU): Discards the least recently used items first.</p></li>
<li><p>Most Recently Used (MRU): Discards, in contrast to LRU, the most recently used items first.</p></li>
<li><p>Least Frequently Used (LFU): Counts how often an item is needed. Those that are used least often are discarded first.</p></li>
<li><p>Random Replacement (RR): Randomly selects a candidate item and discards it to make space when necessary.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="data-partitioning">
<h2>Data Partitioning<a class="headerlink" href="#data-partitioning" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Data partitioning is a technique to break up a big database (DB) into many  smaller parts. It is the process of splitting up a DB/table across  multiple machines to improve the manageability, performance,  availability, and load balancing of an application. The justification  for data partitioning is that, after a certain scale point, it is  cheaper and more feasible to scale horizontally by adding more machines  than to grow it vertically by adding beefier servers.</p>
<section id="partitioning-criteria">
<h3>Partitioning Criteria<a class="headerlink" href="#partitioning-criteria" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Key or Hash-based partitioning: Under this scheme, we apply a hash function to some key attributes of the entity we are storing; that yields the partition number. For example, if we have 100 DB servers and our ID is a numeric value that gets incremented by one each time a new record is inserted. In this example, the hash function could be ‘ID % 100’, which will give us the server number where we can store/read that record. This approach should ensure a uniform allocation of data among servers. The fundamental problem with this approach is that it effectively fixes the total number of DB servers, since adding new servers means changing the hash function which would require redistribution of data and downtime for the service. A workaround for this problem is to use Consistent Hashing.</p></li>
<li><p>List partitioning: In this scheme, each partition is assigned a list of values, so whenever we want to insert a new record, we will see which partition contains our key and then store it there. For example, we can decide all users living in Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, or Denmark will be stored in a partition for the Nordic countries.</p></li>
<li><p>Round-robin partitioning: This is a very simple strategy that ensures uniform data distribution. With ‘n’ partitions, the ‘i’ tuple is assigned to partition (i mod n).</p></li>
<li><p>Composite partitioning: Under this scheme, we combine any of the above partitioning schemes to devise a new scheme. For example, first applying a list partitioning scheme and then a hash based partitioning. Consistent hashing could be considered a composite of hash and list partitioning where the hash reduces the key space to a size that can be listed.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="common-problems-of-data-partitioning">
<h3>Common Problems of Data Partitioning<a class="headerlink" href="#common-problems-of-data-partitioning" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>On a partitioned database, there are certain extra constraints on the different operations that  can be performed. Most of these constraints are due to the fact that  operations across multiple tables or multiple rows in the same table  will no longer run on the same server. Below are some of the constraints and additional complexities introduced by partitioning:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Joins and Denormalization: Performing joins on a database which is running on one server is  straightforward, but once a database is partitioned and spread across  multiple machines it is often not feasible to perform joins that span  database partitions. Such joins will not be performance efficient since  data has to be compiled from multiple servers. A common workaround for  this problem is to denormalize the database so that queries that  previously required joins can be performed from a single table. Of  course, the service now has to deal with all the perils of  denormalization such as data inconsistency.</p></li>
<li><p>Referential integrity: As we saw that performing a cross-partition query on a partitioned  database is not feasible, similarly, trying to enforce data integrity  constraints such as foreign keys in a partitioned database can be  extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Most of RDBMS do not  support foreign keys constraints across databases on different database  servers. Which means that applications that require referential  integrity on partitioned databases often have to enforce it in  application code. Often in such cases, applications have to run regular  SQL jobs to clean up dangling references.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rebalancing: There could be many reasons we have to change our partitioning scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The data distribution is not uniform, e.g., there are a lot of  places for a particular ZIP code that cannot fit into one database  partition.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a lot of load on a partition, e.g., there are too many  requests being handled by the DB partition dedicated to user photos.</p>
<p>In such cases, either we  have to create more DB partitions or have to rebalance existing  partitions, which means the partitioning scheme changed and all existing data moved to new locations. Doing this without incurring downtime is  extremely difficult. Using a scheme like directory based partitioning  does make rebalancing a more palatable experience at the cost of  increasing the complexity of the system and creating a new single point  of failure (i.e. the lookup service/database).</p>

</ul>

<section id="indexes">
<h2>Indexes<a class="headerlink" href="#indexes" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Indexes are well known when it comes to databases. Sooner or later there comes a time when database performance is no longer satisfactory. One of the  very first things you should turn to when that happens is database  indexing.</p>
<p>The goal of creating an  index on a particular table in a database is to make it faster to search through the table and find the row or rows that we want. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the  basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered  records.</p>
<p><strong>Example: A library catalog</strong></p>
<p>A library catalog is a  register that contains the list of books found in a library. The catalog is organized like a database table generally with four columns: book  title, writer, subject, and date of publication. There are usually two  such catalogs: one sorted by the book title and one sorted by the writer name. That way, you can either think of a writer you want to read and  then look through their books or look up a specific book title you know  you want to read in case you don’t know the writer’s name. These  catalogs are like indexes for the database of books. They provide a  sorted list of data that is easily searchable by relevant information.</p>
<!-- ![image-20200809015308869](./staticfiles/images/image-20200809015308869.png) -->
<p>Simply saying, an index is a data structure that can be perceived as a table of contents that  points us to the location where actual data lives. So when we create an  index on a column of a table, we store that column and a pointer to the  whole row in the index. Let’s assume a table containing a list of books, the following diagram shows how an index on the ‘Title’ column looks  like:</p>
<p>Just like a traditional relational data store, we can also apply this  concept to larger datasets. The trick with indexes is that we must  carefully consider how users will access the data. In the case of data  sets that are many terabytes in size, but have very small payloads  (e.g., 1 KB), indexes are a necessity for optimizing data access.  Finding a small payload in such a large dataset can be a real challenge, since we can’t possibly iterate over that much data in any reasonable  time. Furthermore, it is very likely that such a large data set is  spread over several physical devices—this means we need some way to find the correct physical location of the desired data. Indexes are the best way to do this.</p>
<section id="how-do-indexes-decrease-write-performance">
<h3>How do Indexes decrease write performance?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-indexes-decrease-write-performance" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>An index can dramatically  speed up data retrieval but may itself be large due to the additional  keys, which slow down data insertion &amp; update.</p>
<p>When adding rows or making updates to existing rows for a table with an active index, we not only  have to write the data but also have to update the index. This will  decrease the write performance. This performance degradation applies to  all insert, update, and delete operations for the table. For this  reason, adding unnecessary indexes on tables should be avoided and  indexes that are no longer used should be removed. To reiterate, adding  indexes is about improving the performance of search queries. If the  goal of the database is to provide a data store that is often written to and rarely read from, in that case, decreasing the performance of the  more common operation, which is writing, is probably not worth the  increase in performance we get from reading.</p>

<section id="proxies">
<h2>Proxies<a class="headerlink" href="#proxies" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A proxy server is an intermediate server between the client and the  back-end server. Clients connect to proxy servers to make a request for a service like a web page, file, connection, etc. In short, a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">proxy server</a> is a piece of software or hardware that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.</p>
<p>Typically, proxies are  used to filter requests, log requests, or sometimes transform requests  (by adding/removing headers, encrypting/decrypting, or compressing a  resource). Another advantage of a proxy server is that its cache can  serve a lot of requests. If multiple clients access a particular  resource, the proxy server can cache it and serve it to all the clients  without going to the remote server.</p>

<h4>Open Proxy<a class="headerlink" href="#open-proxy" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>An <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opn_proxy">open proxy</a> is a proxy server that is accessible by any Internet user. Generally, a proxy server only allows users within a network group (i.e. a closed  proxy) to store and forward Internet services such as DNS or web pages  to reduce and control the bandwidth used by the group. With an open  proxy, however, any user on the Internet is able to use this forwarding  service. There two famous open proxy types:</p>

<h2>Redundancy and Replication<a class="headerlink" href="#redundancy-and-replication" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)">Redundancy</a> is the duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing the reliability of the system, usually in  the form of a backup or fail-safe, or to improve actual system  performance. For example, if there is only one copy of a file stored on a single server, then losing that server means losing the file. Since  losing data is seldom a good thing, we can create duplicate or redundant copies of the file to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Redundancy plays a key  role in removing the single points of failure in the system and provides backups if needed in a crisis. For example, if we have two instances of a service running in production and one fails, the system can failover  to the other one.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing)">Replication</a> means sharing information to ensure consistency between redundant  resources, such as software or hardware components, to improve  reliability, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance">fault-tolerance</a>, or accessibility.</p>
<p>Replication is widely used in many database management systems (DBMS), usually with a  primary-replica relationship between the original and the copies. The  primary server gets all the updates, which then ripple through to the  replica servers. Each replica outputs a message stating that it has  received the update successfully, thus allowing the sending of  subsequent updates.</p>

<h2>SQL vs. NoSQL<a class="headerlink" href="#sql-vs-nosql" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In the world of databases, there are two main types of solutions: SQL  and NoSQL (or relational databases and non-relational databases). Both  of them differ in the way they were built, the kind of information they  store, and the storage method they use.</p>
<p>Relational databases are  structured and have predefined schemas like phone books that store phone numbers and addresses. Non-relational databases are unstructured,  distributed, and have a dynamic schema like file folders that hold  everything from a person’s address and phone number to their Facebook  ‘likes’ and online shopping preferences.</p>
<section id="sql">
<h3>SQL<a class="headerlink" href="#sql" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Relational databases store data in rows and columns. Each row contains all the information about  one entity and each column contains all the separate data points. Some  of the most popular relational databases are MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL  Server, SQLite, Postgres, and MariaDB.</p>
</section>
<section id="nosql">
<h3>NoSQL<a class="headerlink" href="#nosql" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Following are the most common types of NoSQL:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Key-Value Stores:</strong> Data is stored in an array of key-value pairs. The ‘key’ is an  attribute name which is linked to a ‘value’. Well-known key-value stores include Redis, Voldemort, and Dynamo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Document Databases:</strong> In these databases, data is stored in documents (instead of rows and  columns in a table) and these documents are grouped together in  collections. Each document can have an entirely different structure.  Document databases include the CouchDB and MongoDB.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wide-Column Databases:</strong> Instead of ‘tables,’ in columnar databases we have column families,  which are containers for rows. Unlike relational databases, we don’t  need to know all the columns up front and each row doesn’t have to have  the same number of columns. Columnar databases are best suited for  analyzing large datasets - big names include Cassandra and HBase.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graph Databases:</strong> These databases are used to store data whose relations are best  represented in a graph. Data is saved in graph structures with nodes  (entities), properties (information about the entities), and lines  (connections between the entities). Examples of graph database include  Neo4J and InfiniteGraph.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="high-level-differences-between-sql-and-nosql">
<h3>High level differences between SQL and NoSQL<a class="headerlink" href="#high-level-differences-between-sql-and-nosql" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Storage:</strong>  SQL stores data in tables where each row represents an entity and each  column represents a data point about that entity; for example, if we are storing a car entity in a table, different columns could be ‘Color’,  ‘Make’, ‘Model’, and so on.</p>
<p>NoSQL databases have  different data storage models. The main ones are key-value, document,  graph, and columnar. We will discuss differences between these databases below.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Schema:</strong>  In SQL, each record conforms to a fixed schema, meaning the columns must be decided and chosen before data entry and each row must have data for each column. The schema can be altered later, but it involves modifying the whole database and going offline.</p>
<p>In NoSQL, schemas are  dynamic. Columns can be added on the fly and each ‘row’ (or equivalent)  doesn’t have to contain data for each ‘column.’</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Querying:</strong> SQL databases use SQL (structured query language) for defining and  manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In a NoSQL database,  queries are focused on a collection of documents. Sometimes it is also  called UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). Different databases have  different syntax for using UnQL.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability:</strong> In most common situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable, i.e., by increasing the horsepower (higher Memory, CPU, etc.) of the  hardware, which can get very expensive. It is possible to scale a  relational database across multiple servers, but this is a challenging  and time-consuming process.</p>
<p>On the other hand, NoSQL  databases are horizontally scalable, meaning we can add more servers  easily in our NoSQL database infrastructure to handle a lot of traffic.  Any cheap commodity hardware or cloud instances can host NoSQL  databases, thus making it a lot more cost-effective than vertical  scaling. A lot of NoSQL technologies also distribute data across servers automatically.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reliability or ACID Compliancy (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability):</strong> The vast majority of relational databases are ACID compliant. So, when  it comes to data reliability and safe guarantee of performing  transactions, SQL databases are still the better bet.</p>
<p>Most of the NoSQL solutions sacrifice ACID compliance for performance and scalability.</p>

<h3>SQL VS. NoSQL - Which one to use?<a class="headerlink" href="#sql-vs-nosql-which-one-to-use" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to database  technology, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. That’s why many  businesses rely on both relational and non-relational databases for  different needs. Even as NoSQL databases are gaining popularity for  their speed and scalability, there are still situations where a highly  structured SQL database may perform better; choosing the right  technology hinges on the use case.</p>
</section>
<section id="reasons-to-use-sql-database">
<h3>Reasons to use SQL database<a class="headerlink" href="#reasons-to-use-sql-database" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Here are a few reasons to choose a SQL database:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>We need to ensure ACID compliance. ACID compliance reduces anomalies and protects the integrity of your database by prescribing exactly how  transactions interact with the database. Generally, NoSQL databases  sacrifice ACID compliance for scalability and processing speed, but for  many e-commerce and financial applications, an ACID-compliant database  remains the preferred option.</p></li>
<li><p>Your data is structured and unchanging. If your business is not  experiencing massive growth that would require more servers and if  you’re only working with data that is consistent, then there may be no  reason to use a system designed to support a variety of data types and  high traffic volume.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="reasons-to-use-nosql-database">
<h3>Reasons to use NoSQL database<a class="headerlink" href="#reasons-to-use-nosql-database" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>When all the other  components of our application are fast and seamless, NoSQL databases  prevent data from being the bottleneck. Big data is contributing to a  large success for NoSQL databases, mainly because it handles data  differently than the traditional relational databases. A few popular  examples of NoSQL databases are MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, and HBase.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Storing large volumes of data that often have little to no  structure. A NoSQL database sets no limits on the types of data we can  store together and allows us to add new types as the need changes. With  document-based databases, you can store data in one place without having to define what “types” of data those are in advance.</p></li>
<li><p>Making the most of cloud computing and storage. Cloud-based storage  is an excellent cost-saving solution but requires data to be easily  spread across multiple servers to scale up. Using commodity (affordable, smaller) hardware on-site or in the cloud saves you the hassle of  additional software and NoSQL databases like Cassandra are designed to  be scaled across multiple data centers out of the box, without a lot of  headaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Rapid development. NoSQL is extremely useful for rapid development  as it doesn’t need to be prepped ahead of time. If you’re working on  quick iterations of your system which require making frequent updates to the data structure without a lot of downtime between versions, a  relational database will slow you down.</p></li>

<section id="cap-theorem">
<h2>CAP Theorem<a class="headerlink" href="#cap-theorem" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed software system  to simultaneously provide more than two out of three of the following  guarantees (CAP): Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.  When we design a distributed system, trading off among CAP is almost the first thing we want to consider. CAP theorem says while designing a  distributed system we can pick only two of the following three options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Consistency:</strong> All nodes see the same data at the same time. Consistency is achieved by updating several nodes before allowing further reads.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Availability:</strong> Every request gets a response on success/failure. Availability is achieved by replicating the data across different servers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Partition tolerance:</strong> The system continues to work despite message loss or partial failure. A system that is partition-tolerant can sustain any amount of network  failure that doesn’t result in a failure of the entire network. Data is  sufficiently replicated across combinations of nodes and networks to  keep the system up through intermittent outages.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- ![image-20200809033804638](./staticfiles/images/image-20200809033804638.png) -->
<p>We cannot build a general data store that is continually available,  sequentially consistent, and tolerant to any partition failures. We can  only build a system that has any two of these three properties. Because, to be consistent, all nodes should see the same set of updates in the  same order. But if the network suffers a partition, updates in one  partition might not make it to the other partitions before a client  reads from the out-of-date partition after having read from the  up-to-date one. The only thing that can be done to cope with this  possibility is to stop serving requests from the out-of-date partition,  but then the service is no longer 100% available.</p>

<section id="consistent-hashing">
<h2>Consistent Hashing<a class="headerlink" href="#consistent-hashing" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is one of the fundamental components used in distributed scalable systems. Hash Tables need a key, a value, and a  hash function where hash function maps the key to a location where the  value is stored.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">hash_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Suppose we are designing a distributed caching system. Given ‘n’ cache servers, an intuitive hash  function would be ‘key % n’. It is simple and commonly used. But it has  two major drawbacks:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>It is NOT horizontally scalable. Whenever a new cache host is added  to the system, all existing mappings are broken. It will be a pain point in maintenance if the caching system contains lots of data.  Practically, it becomes difficult to schedule a downtime to update all  caching mappings.</p></li>
<li><p>It may NOT be load balanced, especially for non-uniformly  distributed data. In practice, it can be easily assumed that the data  will not be distributed uniformly. For the caching system, it translates into some caches becoming hot and saturated while the others idle and  are almost empty.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In such situations, consistent hashing is a good way to improve the caching system.</p>
<section id="what-is-consistent-hashing">
<h3>What is Consistent Hashing?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-consistent-hashing" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Consistent hashing is a  very useful strategy for distributed caching systems and DHTs. It allows us to distribute data across a cluster in such a way that will minimize reorganization when nodes are added or removed. Hence, the caching  system will be easier to scale up or scale down.</p>
<p>In Consistent Hashing,  when the hash table is resized (e.g. a new cache host is added to the  system), only ‘k/n’ keys need to be remapped where ‘k’ is the total  number of keys and ‘n’ is the total number of servers. Recall that in a  caching system using the ‘mod’ as the hash function, all keys need to be remapped.</p>
<p>In Consistent Hashing,  objects are mapped to the same host if possible. When a host is removed  from the system, the objects on that host are shared by other hosts;  when a new host is added, it takes its share from a few hosts without  touching other’s shares.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-does-it-work">
<h3>How does it work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-it-work" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>As a typical hash  function, consistent hashing maps a key to an integer. Suppose the  output of the hash function is in the range of [0, 256]. Imagine that  the integers in the range are placed on a ring such that the values are  wrapped around.</p>
<p>Here’s how consistent hashing works:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Given a list of cache servers, hash them to integers in the range.</p></li>
<li><p>To map a key to a server,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Hash it to a single integer.</p></li>
<li><p>Move clockwise on the ring until finding the first cache it encounters.</p></li>
<li><p>That cache is the one that contains the key. See animation below as an example: key1 maps to cache A; key2 maps to cache C.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To add a new server, say D, keys that were originally residing at C will  be split. Some of them will be shifted to D, while other keys will not  be touched.</p>
<p>To remove a cache or, if a cache fails, say A, all keys that were originally mapped to A will fall into B, and only those keys need to be moved to B; other keys will not  be affected.</p>
<p>For load balancing, as we  discussed in the beginning, the real data is essentially randomly  distributed and thus may not be uniform. It may make the keys on caches  unbalanced.</p>
<p>To handle this issue, we  add “virtual replicas” for caches. Instead of mapping each cache to a  single point on the ring, we map it to multiple points on the ring, i.e. replicas. This way, each cache is associated with multiple portions of  the ring.</p>
<p>If the hash function “mixes well,” as the number of replicas increases, the keys will be more balanced.</p>

<h2>Long-Polling vs WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events<a class="headerlink" href="#long-polling-vs-websockets-vs-server-sent-events" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Long-Polling, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events are popular communication protocols  between a client like a web browser and a web server. First, let’s start with understanding what a standard HTTP web request looks like.  Following are a sequence of events for regular HTTP request:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The client opens a connection and requests data from the server.</p></li>
<li><p>The server calculates the response.</p></li>
<li><p>The server sends the response back to the client on the opened request.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="ajax-polling">
<h3>Ajax Polling<a class="headerlink" href="#ajax-polling" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Polling is a standard  technique used by the vast majority of AJAX applications. The basic idea is that the client repeatedly polls (or requests) a server for data.  The client makes a request and waits for the server to respond with  data. If no data is available, an empty response is returned.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The client opens a connection and requests data from the server using regular HTTP.</p></li>
<li><p>The requested webpage sends requests to the server at regular intervals (e.g., 0.5 seconds).</p></li>
<li><p>The server calculates the response and sends it back, just like regular HTTP traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>The client repeats the above three steps periodically to get updates from the server.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The problem with Polling  is that the client has to keep asking the server for any new data. As a  result, a lot of responses are empty, creating HTTP overhead.</p>

<section id="http-long-polling">
<h3>HTTP Long-Polling<a class="headerlink" href="#http-long-polling" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This is a variation of the traditional polling technique that allows the server to push  information to a client whenever the data is available. With  Long-Polling, the client requests information from the server exactly as in normal polling, but with the expectation that the server may not  respond immediately. That’s why this technique is sometimes referred to  as a “Hanging GET”.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the server does not have any data available for the client,  instead of sending an empty response, the server holds the request and  waits until some data becomes available.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the data becomes available, a full response is sent to the  client. The client then immediately re-request information from the  server so that the server will almost always have an available waiting  request that it can use to deliver data in response to an event.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The basic life cycle of an application using HTTP Long-Polling is as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The client makes an initial request using regular HTTP and then waits for a response.</p></li>
<li><p>The server delays its response until an update is available or a timeout has occurred.</p></li>
<li><p>When an update is available, the server sends a full response to the client.</p></li>
<li><p>The client typically sends a new long-poll request, either  immediately upon receiving a response or after a pause to allow an  acceptable latency period.</p></li>
<li><p>Each Long-Poll request has a timeout. The client has to reconnect periodically after the connection is closed due to timeouts.</p></li>

<h3>WebSockets<a class="headerlink" href="#websockets" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>WebSocket provides <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#Full_duplex">Full duplex</a> communication channels over a single TCP connection. It provides a persistent  connection between a client and a server that both parties can use to  start sending data at any time. The client establishes a WebSocket  connection through a process known as the WebSocket handshake. If the  process succeeds, then the server and client can exchange data in both  directions at any time. The WebSocket protocol enables communication between a client and a  server with lower overheads, facilitating real-time data transfer from  and to the server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the browser without being asked by  the client and allowing for messages to be passed back and forth while  keeping the connection open. In this way, a two-way (bi-directional)  ongoing conversation can take place between a client and a server.</p>

<h3>Server-Sent Events (SSEs)<a class="headerlink" href="#server-sent-events-sses" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Under SSEs the client  establishes a persistent and long-term connection with the server. The  server uses this connection to send data to a client. If the client  wants to send data to the server, it would require the use of another  technology/protocol to do so.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Client requests data from a server using regular HTTP.</p></li>
<li><p>The requested webpage opens a connection to the server.</p></li>
<li><p>The server sends the data to the client whenever there’s new information available.</p></li>

<p>SSEs are best when we need real-time traffic from the server to the client or if the server is  generating data in a loop and will be sending multiple events to the  client.</p>
