    "# Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "A priority queue acts like a queue in that you dequeue an item by removing it from the front. However, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue is determined by their priority. The highest priority items are at the front of the queue and the lowest priority items are at the back. Thus when you enqueue an item on a priority queue, the new item may move all the way to the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways to implement a priority queue using sorting functions and lists. However, inserting into a list is `O(n)` and sorting a list is `O(nlogn)`. We can do better. The classic way to implement a priority queue is using a data structure called a **binary heap**. A **binary heap** will allow us both enqueue and dequeue items in `O(logn)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary heap has two common variations: the min heap, in which the smallest key is always at the front, and the max heap, in which the largest key value is always at the front.\n",

    "## Priority Queue Abstract Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The priority queue abstract data type is defined by the following structure and operations. A priority queue is structured, as described above, as an ordered collection of items which are added at one end, called the **“rear”**, and removed from the other end, called the **“front”**. Queues maintain a **FIFO** ordering property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priority Queue Operations\n",
    "- `PriorityQueue()` creates a new priority queue that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty queue.\n",
    "- `enqueue(item)` adds a new item to the rear of the queue. It needs the item and returns nothing.\n",
    "- `dequeue()` removes the front item from the queue. It needs no parameters and returns the item. The queue is modified.\n",
    "- `is_empty()` tests to see whether the queue is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a boolean value.\n",
    "- `size()` returns the number of items in the queue. It needs no parameters and returns an integer.\n",
