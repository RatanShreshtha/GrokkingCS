    "Graphs can be used to represent many interesting things about our world, including systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete a major in computer science.\n",

    "- **Vertex**: A vertex (also called a “node”) is a fundamental part of a graph. It can have a name, which we will call the **“key”**. A vertex may also have additional information. We will call this additional information the “payload.”\n",
    "- **Edge**: An edge (also called an “arc”) is another fundamental part of a graph. An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way. If the edges in a graph are all one-way, we say that the graph is a **directed graph**, or a digraph.\n",
    "- **Weight**: Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another. For example in a graph of roads that connect one city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance between the two cities.\n",
    "- **Path**: A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. Formally we would define a path as `w1,w2,...,wn` such that `(wi,wi+1) ∈ E` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n−1`. The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path, specifically n−1. The weighted path length is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the path.\n",
    "- **Cycle**: A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A graph with no cycles is called an **acyclic graph**. A directed graph with no cycles is called a **directed acyclic graph(DAG)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph can be represented by `G` where `G=(V,E)`. For the graph `G`, `V` is a set of vertices and `E` is a set of edges. Each edge is a tuple `(v,w)` where `w,v ∈ V`. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to represent a weight. A subgraph s is a set of edges e and vertices v such that `e ⊂ E` and `v ⊂ V`."

    "Given a graph `G` and a starting vertex `s`, a breadth first search proceeds by exploring edges in the graph to find all the vertices in `G` for which there is a path from `s`. The remarkable thing about a breadth first search is that it finds all the vertices that are a distance `k` from s before it finds any vertices that are a distance `k+1`.\n",

The reason is that *every vertex is dequeued at most once* and we examine an edge from node u to node v only when node u is dequeued.
