    "A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the **“rear”**, and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the **“front”**. As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward the front, waiting it is the next element to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recently added item in the queue must wait at the end of the collection. The item that has been in the collection the longest is at the front. This ordering principle is sometimes called **FIFO(first-in, first-out)**. It is also known as “first-come first-served.”\n",

    "\n",
    "An abstract data type (ADT) when given a physical implementation then we refer to the implementation as a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any object-oriented programming language, the implementation of choice for an abstract data type such as a **Queue** is the creation of a new class. The queue operations are implemented as methods. Further, to implement a queue, which is a collection of elements, it makes sense to utilize the primitive collections provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides `List` an ordered collection mechanism and a set of methods, rear is at position 0 in the list. This allows us to use the insert function on lists to add new elements to the **rear** of the queue. The pop operation can be used to remove the **front** element (the last element of the list). Recall that this also means that enqueue will be O(n) and dequeue will be O(1)."

The printer could be switched to give better quality, but then it would produce only five pages per minute. The slower printing speed could make students wait too long.
