<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

GrokkingCS is an open source project for learning and revising computer science in a hurry for your upcoming technical interviews or just for fun it provides beautiful well organized layout along with interactivity.

<!-- Run Locally -->
### :running: Run Locally

If you'd like to develop and/or build the GrokkingCS book, you should:

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RatanShreshtha/GrokkingCS.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd GrokkingCS
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Edit the books source files located in the `src/` directory

Cleanup the old builds in local directory 

```bash
  jupyter-book clean src/
```

Build the notebook in local directory 

```bash
  jupyter-book build src/
```

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `src/_build/html/`.


<!-- Deployment -->
### :triangular_flag_on_post: Deployment

Please see the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/web.html) to discover options for deploying a book online using services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify.

For GitHub and GitLab deployment specifically, the [cookiecutter-jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book) includes templates for, and information about, optional continuous integration (CI) workflow files to help easily and automatically deploy books online with GitHub or GitLab. For example, if you chose `github` for the `include_ci` cookiecutter option, your book template was created with a GitHub actions workflow file that, once pushed to GitHub, automatically renders and pushes your book to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo and hosts it on GitHub Pages when a push or pull request is made to the main branch.
